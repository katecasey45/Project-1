Welcome to my first code project!! 

When we initially researched critical design, I was drawn to the ide aof consumerism and how we are under the illusion that  online shopping is something we have control over. I perused Amazon and thought a lot about how many of the product listings  don't even really exist until you purchase them. I thought it would be interesting to examine the concept of the maximalist,  ambiguous approach to online shopping in a sort of parodical exposee. My platform is purposefully minimalist in design, and my goal is to frustrate users with a "bare bones" and much more honest version of the shopping that they already experience.
